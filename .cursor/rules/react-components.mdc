- separate components into a thin wrapper component and an implementation component that contains the logic. The goal should be to "inject" things that we don't need to test into the implementation component.
- use react testing library to write tests against the implementation component. Make sure there are always tests on implementation components.
- when tests are changed or code covered by tests are changed, run them to make sure they pass.
